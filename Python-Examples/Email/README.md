#Email examples

There are four examples used to send an email from your Edison Compute Module. The examples are:
* SendHTMLText.py
* SendImage.py
* SendSimpleText.py
* SendtoSeveralReceivers.py

Each example will require the credentials of the sender email and the receiver email address before they can send the email.

The example SendImage.py requires an image to be sent. This image must be in the same directory where the example is.
